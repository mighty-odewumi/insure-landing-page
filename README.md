## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learnt about making a fullscreen navigation with JS.


### Continued development

One thing I think to learn to do more is the issue of navigation. I want the navigation to able to change from mobile to desktop without any issues. Currently, my project has an issue with the mobile nav not turning into the desktop nav except on fresh reload of the page which I think is not supposed to be so. 


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding some concepts like setting the background of an image to stretch to fill the whole screen completely. I also had help with using their JS code to make a nav that fills the mobile screen 100%.

A shoutout to the W3Schools website that enabled me to understand how to make a fullscreen navigation on mobile screens.
