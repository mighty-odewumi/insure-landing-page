## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about making a fullscreen navigation with JS.


### Continued development

One thing I think I wanna learn to do more is the issue of navigation. I want the navigation to able to change from mobile to desktop without any issues. Currently, my project has an issue with the mobile nav not turning into the desktop nav except on fresh reload of the page which I think is not supposed to be so. 


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding some concepts like setting the background of an image to stretch to fill the whole screen completely. I also had help with using their JS code to make a nav that fills the mobile screen 100%.
